## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This was the hardest challenge i have taken so far, but thanks to it, i strenghtened my css skills and i learned new concepts
like overflow, i used different units that i haven't used before such as VH and VW. Despite the solution wasn't really similar, 
i'm satisfied with it.

some meaningful code snippets:

```css
html{
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on Css position, css grid, start my journey with javascript and of course learn other css elements.


### Useful resources

- [Overflow CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - This helped me understand how overflow works
